    <h2><a href="https://github.com/tamul/simplelogger">Custom Python Logging</a></h2>
    <p>At the time I didn't want to take the time to learn Python's default logging utility, so I did the logical thing and wasted time making my own.<br />
    It works great for my little scripts that I run on a schedule in the background, but I wouldn't suggest it for bigger applications.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/Progether/JAdventure">The Progether Subreddit's Java Text Adventure Game</a></h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://reddit.com/r/progether">Progether Subreddit</a> has been creating a text-based adventure game in Java for quite some time. It was originally worked on by a select few, including myself, but soon the project was abandoned. GitHub users such as <a href="https://github.com/projectdelphai">projectdelphai</a> have helped revive the project, and with it the subreddit. My fork of the project is <a href="https://github.com/tamul/JAdventure">here</a></p>

    <h2><a href="https://github.com/tamul/Pathfinder">Java Pathfinder Demo</a></h2>
    <p>Demos the "decision making" in some algorithms I created. Not very useful, but kind of neat to watch.</p>
