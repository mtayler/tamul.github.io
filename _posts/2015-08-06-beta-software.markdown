Using Beta Software
===
To use beta software, a certain attitude needs to be embraced. Those who expect their software to "just work" should definitely not be using beta software -– or usually even the most current!

Bugs
---
Most of the fun using beta software comes from solving problems, specifically the bunch of bugs you encounter. Recently I encountered a bug using Apple's 3rd public beta of their upcoming OS X 10.11 "El Capitan" where opening the context menu in Finder caused an exception -- specifically an unrecognized selector. I had a hunch this was due to some software recently loaded for the first time in the beta, and began looking for a solution. This bug led to a fun little pursuit of attempting killing processes and right clicking, then finding a way to remove Finder actions when the context menu is the most viable option of accessing the actions setup menu.

####Responsiblity
Users of beta software have a certain responsiblity to uphold. While the bug I'd found was due to software that wasn't compatible with the beta software I was using, more often you find bugs local to the beta software itself. As a user of beta software you've agreed to an unwritten -- or occasionally written -- agreement in which users report bugs to the developer, or at least not complaining about them.
