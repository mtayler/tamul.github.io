  <h2><a href="https://github.com/tamul/psuedo-encrypt">Pseudo Encrypt</a></h2>
  <p>A <b>very</b> insecure RSA encryption implementation. Not useful for much, but my understanding of RSA and modulus arithmetic was hugely enriched doing this project.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://github.com/tamul/Pathfinder">Java Pathfinder Demo</a></h2>
  <p>Demos the "decision making" in some algorithms I created. Not very useful, but kind of neat to watch.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://github.com/tamul/simplelogger">Custom Python Logging</a></h2>
  <p>At the time I didn't want to take the time to learn Python's default logging utility, so I did the logical thing and wasted time making my own.<br />
  It works great for my little scripts that I run on a schedule in the background, but I wouldn't suggest it for bigger applications.</p>
