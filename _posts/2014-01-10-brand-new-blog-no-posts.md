title: Brand New Blog, No Posts!
---
This is not only my first blog post, but my first blog post of my first blog! I'm excited to start an effort to start blogging/documenting/sharing projects! My projects usually entail programming (generally Python, C, and Java) Arduino and electronics projects (Arduino code is based off C) and some miscellaneous stuff. I have a list of current projects [here](projects.html).
